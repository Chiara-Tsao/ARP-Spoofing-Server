In this implementation, a Windows Form will be used to create a Client/Server ARP Spoofing to block specific IPs from accessing the Internet, and the Client will send the host information to be blocked to the Server for ARP Spoofing blocking. What is ARP Spoofing will be briefly explained in this implementation. The main concept is to make the host unable to access the Internet by continuously sending ARP spoofing packets to a specific host.
